        <h1>Game Rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Your goal is to control the snake and eat as much food as possible to score points.</li>
            <li>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.</li>
            <li>The game starts with a single snake segment on the board. Move the snake around the board to collect food. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.</li>
            <li>Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.</li>
            <li>Each time the snake eats food, your score increases. Additionally, there is a high score displayed, representing your best performance in the game.</li>
            <li>When the game ends, a message will appear indicating "Game Over". Press any key to play again and restart the game.</li>
            <li>Have fun playing the snake game and challenge yourself to beat your high score!</li>
